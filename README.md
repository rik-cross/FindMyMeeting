# Find My Meeting
### A Google Chrome extension that finds an active Google Meet tab.

Click the extension icon in the toolbar to give focus to any Google Meet tab with active sound. If there is more than one Google Meet tab, the extension gives focus to the first one it finds. Works across multiple Chrome windows.

Useful for times when you are in a meeting and lose your Google Meet tab.
